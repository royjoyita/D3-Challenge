# D3-Challenge

Using the D3 techniques I created a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. I have coded this graphic in the app.js file of the repository and pulled the data from data.csv by using the d3.csv function. 

Included state abbreviations in the circles.

Created and situated the axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.
